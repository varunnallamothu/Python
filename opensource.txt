                               -> post a query in intenet ( support/workaround)

Us(customers)  -> requirements -> post mail to company ( we will get back to you)
                               -> post a query in intenet ( support/workaround)
                               
guy/gal B -> download the code -> modification 
          -> product B(GPL) -> published the source code.
